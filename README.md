> <center> <h1> Online Store ( Frontend project ) </h1></center>

</br>

> As the fifth project was required by th GeeksHubs staff, we were assigned to work on this project as a team, to cover all aspects (from backend to fronted) of this online store.

### The team consisted of the following members (in alphabetical order);
>https://github.com/Alexdck (Mac)
https://github.com/Claudia1010 (Windows)
https://github.com/obordonado (Linux)


> <b>The backend</b> of a previous project (https://github.com/obordonado/Blueclub) was taken as example and modified to suit the requirements, adjusting its code, and the previous DDBB.

>We've used MySql-WorkBench to connect to the DDBB in order to see in real time any modifications made.

> The DDBB has been deployed at https://heroku-sqlurl.herokuapp.com/ to imitate a 24h online store.

> The Front-End (https://github.com/Alexdck/teamProyectReact) 

> To make this project, we've worked remotely (from home) to better understand its difficulties and overcome them as a proffessional team working 100% in full remote.
> All the icons at the header allude to the technologies we've used in for this project.

#### The requirements for this project included;

>- React and Redux as the base.
>- Connections to endpoints to be made through Axios.
>- Must be a Single Page Application.
>- Must be responsive.
>- Passwords must be secured (We hashed them with Bcrypt)

#### Home Page

> In the Home page we decided to put a carousel so the user may see some of the options he can purchase as well as to make it more dynamic.
> At the top we included a NavBar, for the user to click on and the user can:
>- View all possible movies.
>- Register.
>- Log in.
